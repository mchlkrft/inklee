# Plus build: live progress log

**Purpose:** a supervisor-readable status file, updated as work happens, so
progress can be monitored without interrupting implementation. The PLAN lives
in `plus-build-plan.md`; this file is the running state of executing it.

Last updated: 2026-07-29. Milestone 2 (Gate B schema) ready for review. Branch `feat/p5d-collections`.

---

## Current objective

**Stage P5, goods tools.** Build the remaining commerce features behind the
Plus package. Everything lands dark or Free-invisible; consumer billing stays
closed throughout (DB-backed launch key untouched).

**P5d is NOT complete.** The claim in `d890a07` was wrong and is retracted.
Rebuilding the whole capability against the approved design on
`feat/p5d-collections`. Status: **in implementation**.

## Completed and pushed

| Stage | Commit | What |
|---|---|---|
| P3a | `e28c62d` | Conditional booking-form questions, web + native (migration 0114) |
| P3b-f | `879ddbb` | Booking-form templates, cover unification, confirmation page, custom slug, scheduled books-open date |
| P4 | `536b067` | Large-project mode: schema, intake, artist UI, native twins (migration 0115) |
| P5a | `4687c19` | Platform fee engine, fee actuals, refund-policy data, dispute handling (migration 0116) |
| P4 follow-up | `54ec5fc` | Project client portal + project emails (migration 0117) |
| P5b | `7e504db` | Discount codes (migration 0118) |
| Audit fixes | `1f8b5e9` | Seven findings from the self-audit of the above |
| P5c | `9ce0b21` | Scheduled drops, preorders, low-stock alerts (migration 0119) |
| P5d | `d890a07` | ❌ **RETRACTED.** Shipped broken; see the defect record below |
| Native parity | `0de2034` | Native discount + product-scheduling editors (COMPLETE, not paused) |

Migrations 0114-0120 are applied to production and verified there.

**Live config change:** the Stripe LIVE webhook endpoint
(`we_1TpPmyHkG0exykzFYTq26SyV`) now subscribes to
`charge.dispute.created/updated/closed`, so the P5a dispute handler is
actually reachable. Verified by re-reading the endpoint.

## Retracted: the P5d completion claim

`d890a07` was pushed to master and migration `0120` applied to production
while the feature does not work.

**Root cause.** Migration 0120 created `product_collections` with RLS enabled
and only a SELECT policy. Every write path (`saveCollectionCore`,
`deleteCollectionCore`, `setProductCollectionCore`) runs on the USER-scoped
Supabase client, so Postgres rejects every insert, update and delete.

Reproduced on 2026-07-29 with an authenticated anon-key client against local
Supabase:

```
AUTHENTICATED INSERT -> BLOCKED: new row violates row-level security
policy for table "product_collections"
```

**Why the gate missed it.** The 13 tests I wrote exercise
`groupProductsByCollection`, a pure function. Nothing in the suite touched the
real permission model, and the two READ paths work (the SELECT policy exists),
so typecheck, unit tests, e2e, lint and the production build were all green
against a feature that cannot be used. Sibling tables in this repo (`projects`,
`discount_codes`) are also SELECT-only, but their writes go through the SERVICE
client; I copied the policy shape without checking which client the writes use.
That is the exact class of mistake the earlier audit already caught me making:
matching a sibling's surface without checking the constraint it relies on.

**Standing correction:** any new RLS-protected table whose writes use the
user-scoped client needs an authenticated regression test that fails without
the write policy. Added to the required-test list below.

## In implementation: P5d rebuild

Branch `feat/p5d-collections`. No intermediate pushes to master. Migration
0120 is never edited; every repair is forward-only.

### Milestone 1: Gate A, write-policy repair — DONE (`805358d`)

Migration `0121`. 10 authenticated tests. Verified by DROPPING the policies and
re-running: 9 of 10 fail; restored, 10 of 10 pass.

### Milestone 2 (current): Gate B, the collection model

Migration `0122`: `product_collection_items` (many-to-many, per-collection
`position`, unique per collection+product, cascade FKs, ownership-safe RLS
whose WITH CHECK verifies BOTH referenced rows), `product_collections.archived_at`,
a backfill of every legacy assignment, and a trigger mirroring legacy
`products.collection_id` writes into the new model.

The trigger is not defensive theatre: `products` carries a FOR ALL policy, so
any authenticated artist can still write `collection_id` straight through
PostgREST. Without it the two models could silently disagree.

`products.collection_id` is NOT dropped. That is the contract step, in a later
migration, after production equivalence is verified.

13 further authenticated tests: one product in two collections with
independent positions, duplicate rejection, reorder, removal without touching
the product, four cross-account cases, legacy mirroring / clearing /
idempotency, and cascade on product delete.

**Found and fixed during verification:** neither 0121 nor 0122 was idempotent,
because Postgres has no `create policy if not exists` and a bare create aborts
a re-run. Both now drop-then-create and re-run cleanly under `ON_ERROR_STOP`.
Neither is in production yet, so both could still be corrected.

### Milestones after Gate A

3. Server behaviour: next-position on create, sparse updates, archive /
   restore / eligible-delete lifecycle, cap removal, entitlement + kill-switch
   at public reads, flat-shop fallback.
4. Featured-collection Linkhub block, parser-enforced.
5. Native collection management, full parity list.
6. Docs, capability registry, parity register, full test suite.

## Blocked or postponed

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| Fee schedule v2 activation | Needs accountant approval of fee and tax treatment. No longer blocked by engineering: the goods fee base is correct now that discounts exist. |
| `fee-refund-policy` v1 activation | Same accountant approval, plus Terms review. |
| Bundles | Multi-product pricing with its own stock and refund semantics. Larger than the rest of P5 combined; deliberately after collections, which it would build on. |
| Goods sales analytics | Belongs with the P6 analytics plane rather than duplicating a second reporting path. |
| Shop customization beyond the appearance system | The shared appearance system already covers the visual layer; what remains is unspecified. |
| Variants+ beyond today's basic set | No concrete requirement recorded beyond what exists. |
| Fresh EAS build | The two native editors (`0de2034`) are on master but not on devices. Batch with the P5d native work rather than burning a build per slice. |
| Bundles | Unchanged: still the largest unstarted P5 item, after P5d is genuinely complete. |
| Cover image Free-vs-Plus conflict | Founder decision, logged in `plus-commercial-packages.md` §7. |

## Next intended action

Milestone 3: server behaviour. Read and write through the join table, assign
the next collection position on create, make updates sparse, add the
archive / restore / eligible-delete lifecycle, remove the cap, and enforce
entitlement plus kill switch at the public read with a flat-shop fallback.
